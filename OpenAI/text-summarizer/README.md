# Text Summarization with OpenAI

This directory contains examples of text summarization using OpenAI's language models.

## Contents

- **[text-process.ipynb](text-process.ipynb)**: Jupyter notebook demonstrating text summarization techniques
  - Shows how to process and prepare text for summarization
  - Implements various summarization approaches using OpenAI models
  - Compares different prompt engineering techniques for better summaries
  - Includes examples of extractive and abstractive summarization

## Getting Started

To use this notebook:

1. Ensure you have access to OpenAI API or Azure OpenAI Service
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install openai pandas numpy matplotlib jupyter
   ```
