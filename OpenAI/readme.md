# OpenAI Samples

## Introduction

This sample set is structured into three main folders, each serving a unique purpose in demonstrating and exploring various aspects of machine learning, prompt engineering, and plugin development.

### Folders Overview

1. **Intro**: This folder serves as the starting point for understanding and using our resources. It contains:

   - `azure-functions-June-2023-Updates.txt`: Sample data files used for a RAG demo.
   - `dall-e.ipynb`: Notebook containing GPT-4 Vision and Dall-E3 sample code.
   - `langchain.ipynb`: Demonstrates a complete RAG pipeline using langchain, including creating embeddings, storing them, and implementing hybrid lookup. It also compares regular LLM queries with RAG-implemented LLM queries.
   - `quickstart.ipynb`: A simple notebook to test the local environment, ensuring compatibility with both OpenAI and Langchain.
   - `requirement.txt`: Lists all the necessary requirements and dependencies for the setup.

2. **Plug-in-Development**: This folder is dedicated to plugin development, featuring:

   - A customized version of the Semantic Kernel ChatGPT plugin starter.
   - A Semantic Kernel C# Hello World Starter for testing the plugin with OpenAI.

3. **Prompt-Engineering**: Here, you'll find various notebooks that delve into prompt engineering techniques. These notebooks showcase how these techniques can be applied and demonstrate their results.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, clone it to your local machine and install the necessary dependencies listed in `requirement.txt`. Each folder contains its own set of files and instructions, so navigate to the folder that aligns with your interest or project needs.
