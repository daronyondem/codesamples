# AutoGen Examples

This directory contains sample projects demonstrating the use of Microsoft's AutoGen framework, which enables the development of LLM-powered multi-agent systems. The examples are organized in two versions:

## [V1](V1)

A collection of Jupyter notebooks exploring fundamental AutoGen concepts:

- `01-conversation.ipynb`: Demonstrates basic agent conversation patterns
- `02-human-input.ipynb`: Shows how to incorporate human input into agent workflows
- `03-code-execution.ipynb`: Examples of agents that can write and execute code
- `04-story-writer.ipynb`: Creative writing use case with AutoGen
- `05-reasoning.ipynb`: Advanced reasoning capabilities with tree of thought techniques

## [V2](V2)

Python scripts implementing more complex agent architectures:

- `01-single-agent.py`: Basic single agent implementation
- `02-multi-agent-problem-solving.py`: Multiple agents collaborating to solve problems
- `03-multi-agent-orchestration.py`: Advanced orchestration of multiple agents

## Setup

Each version has its own setup requirements:

- For V1: Use `requirements.txt` in the V1 directory.
- For V2: Follow the instructions in the [V2 README](V2/README.md) to set up your environment.
