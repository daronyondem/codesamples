# AutoGen Core

- [Documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/user-guide/core-user-guide/index.html)

AutoGen core offers an easy way to quickly build event-driven, distributed, scalable, resilient AI agent systems. Agents are developed by using the [Actor model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model). You can build and run your agent system locally and easily move to a distributed system in the cloud when you are ready.
