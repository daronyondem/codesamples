In my opinion, you should take her to SGPGI, Lucknow and consult pulmonologist there.She needs bronchoscopy, BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) analysis and TBLB (Trans bronchial lung biopsy).BAL analysis will identify the causative organism for pneumonia. TBLB is needed to rule out lung cancer. Don\u0027t worry, she will be alright. First diagnose her and then start appropriate treatment. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your mother. Thanks.\r\n\r\n"}
