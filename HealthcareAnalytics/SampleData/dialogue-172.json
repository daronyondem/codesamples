{"Id":172,"Description":"Suggest treatment for pneumonia\r\n\r\n","DialogueText":"Patient:\r\nWent to the doctor 3 weeks ago for possible exercise induced asthma due to chest pain. They have me a daily steriod inhaler and albuterol rescue inhaler. The did an xray as well and a few days later I found out I had pneumonia. I did a zpack for 5 days and now levaquin 500mg twice daily on day 7 or 10. Just last night I went to urgent they said I still have the pneumonia got a steroid injection and a medrol dose pack. Still getting worse...not sure what to do and the chest pain seems worse, and the levaquin has made my stomach very irritated which is expected. The steroids make sleeping impossible and I constantly feel overheated since the injections and dose pack I started yesterday.\r\nDoctor:\r\nHi and welcome in HCMAccording to the history this might be  a situation called *Nonresponding Pneumonia*It would be better to be hospitalized for further examinations like:CRPHemogramALT,ASTChest CT (if needed)ABGFor exploring better the situation and do the treatment in i/v route .If you have comorbidites they should be evaluated too.Sometimes when the other comorbidities are not well treated the pneumonia does not respond so well from the treatment.So please discuss with your doctor for the aboveRegardsDr.Jolanda\r\n\r\n"}
