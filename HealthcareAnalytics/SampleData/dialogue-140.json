I don t have much choice rather rest than feel pain I. Chest.\r\nDoctor:\r\nThanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern.Pneumonia usually takes 2-3 weeks for complete recovery.Your oxygen requirement is decreasing. This is suggestive of recovery. So you will definitely be alright after 4 weeks. So get done repeat chest x ray to see how much pneumonia is recovered.Chest physiotherapy, deep breathing exercises, incentive spirometry are vital to achieve good lung functions after pneumonia.Don\u0027t worry, you will be alright.Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.\r\n\r\n"}
