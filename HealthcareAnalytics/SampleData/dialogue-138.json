Its been going on for about 3 months right after my boyfriends grandmother got sick with pneumonia and sepsis. Im worried that something could be wrong because I was in the hospital with her a lot and she cough on me quite a bit and I am a type one diabetic should I go talk to my family doctor about it?\r\nDoctor:\r\nThanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern.Yes, you should definitely consult your doctor.Pneumonia spread by coughing. So you might have cought infection from your boyfriend \u0027s grandmother. You are also a diabetic, so lung infections are very easy to affect you.So better to consult your doctor and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and chest x ray.If chest x ray is normal then no need to worry for pneumonia, take simple painkiller like paracetamol for your chest pain.Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.\r\n\r\n"}
