By your history and description, possibility of severe pneumonia with sepsis and MODS (multiple organ dysfunction syndrome) is more likely.Best treatment of pneumonia is identification of causative organism and then start appropriate treatment. So get done bronchoscopy and BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) culture and sensitivity report.Also get done blood culture and sensitivity report. Culture report will isolate the causative organism and sensitivity report will guide about effective antibiotic treatment. By this we can achieve faster recovery. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.\r\n\r\n"}
