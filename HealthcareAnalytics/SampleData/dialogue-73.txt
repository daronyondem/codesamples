It can develop after the age of 60 years especially if the patient is having bronchitis and recurrent pneumonia.Yes, you are right about survival. It is not having a good prognosis.But, now day\u2019s newer treatments like Pirfenidone and N acetylcysteine (NAC) drugs are available. So consult pulmonologist and discuss these newer treatments.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Kaushal Bhavsar\r\n\r\n"}
