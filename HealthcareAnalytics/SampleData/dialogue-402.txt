Am wondering if picking up groceries curbside (have to get out of car and open trunk for store employee) is safe?\r\nDoctor:\r\nIn brief:   Yes and no.   Yes for the first question.   For the second question i should say no because the possibility of the store employee coming close less than 6 feet is great. But what you can do is you get out of the car open the truck and then call the store employee for a curb side pick up leaving always a 6 feet distance between two of you.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?         \r\n\r\n"}
