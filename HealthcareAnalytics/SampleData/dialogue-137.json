{"Id":137,"Description":"Suggest treatment for pneumonia\r\n\r\n","DialogueText":"Patient:\r\nI was diagnosed with a very large  pneumonia about a month ago in my left upper lobe, I have been on 3 different kinds of antibiotics.  I just received a phone call from my doctor with the results from my follow up chest xray and find out that the pneumonia has not gone away and is still about the same size.  What should be our next step?  She wants to put me on another type of anibiotic.\r\nDoctor:\r\nThanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern.You are having persistent lung opacity despite of antibiotic treatment.So possibility of these is very high. 1. Drug resistant infection2. MalignancySo better to first diagnose and then start appropriate treatment.Bronchoscopy and CT scan of thorax are advised in your case.Bronchoscopy will isolate the causative organism and guide about specific antibiotic therapy.CT scan will tell you if there is mass lesion present or not.Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.\r\n\r\n"}
