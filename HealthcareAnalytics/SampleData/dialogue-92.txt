{"Id":92,"Description":"What is the treatment for pneumonia?\r\n\r\n","DialogueText":"Patient:\r\nmy daughter is 3 and a half...has had pneumonia twice and is currently being treated with seretide inhaler, ventoline exohaler, brozedex and ebastel.  Her chest infection though isn\u0027t clearing and her appetitie is low.  She complains of chest pains.  What is the best way to get her treated and cured?   She has used seretide for over 4 months now and it has a steroide and that may have side effects, but the doctor says she must have it to stop the infection, but that isn\u0027t working either.\r\nDoctor:\r\nThanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you should consult pediatric pulmonologist and get done bronchoscopy and BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) analysis.BAL culture and sensitivity report will isolate the causative organism and guide about effective antibiotic treatment. So we can achieve faster recovery from this. Don\u0027t worry, with effective antibiotic treatment, she will be alright with 2 - 3 weeks treatment.Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your daughter. Thanks.\r\n\r\n"}
