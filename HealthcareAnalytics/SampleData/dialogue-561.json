As summer approaches, is it expected to reduce in tropical summers at least.\r\nDoctor:\r\nIn brief:   Coronavirus.    Yes, according to previous knowledge, most virus including coronavirus likely will not survive hotter climates.   I would expect or hope this will die down in summer time. Nevertheless, this is new coronavirus, let\u0027s wait and see. I also think that with strong human intervention, the virus may reduce or be eliminated before summer.   Would you like to video or text chat with me?         \r\n\r\n"}
