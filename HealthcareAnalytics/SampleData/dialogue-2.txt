{"Id":2,"Description":"I have a little fever with no history of foreign travel or contact. What is the chance of Covid-19?\r\n\r\n","DialogueText":"Patient:\r\nHello doctor, I am suffering from coughing, throat infection from last week. At that time fever did not persist and also did not felt any chest pain. Two days later, I consulted with a doctor. He prescribed Cavidur 625, Montek LC, Ambrolite syrup and Betaline gargle solution. Since then throat infection improved and frequent cough also coming out. Coughing also improved remarkably though not completely. From yesterday onwards fever is occuring (maximum 100-degree Celcius). I have not come in touch with any foreign returned person nor went outside. In our state, there is no incidence of Covid-19. Please suggest what to do?\r\nDoctor:\r\nHello, I can understand your concern.\r\nIn my opinion, you should get done a chest x-ray and CBC (complete blood count). If both these are normal then no need to worry much. I hope this helps.\r\nPatient:\r\nThank you doctor,\r\nAfter doing all these I can upload all for further query.\r\nDoctor:\r\nHi, yes, upload in this query only. I will see and revert to you.\r\nPatient:\r\nThank you doctor,\r\nAs per your guidelines, I have made one test. Due to city shutdown, I could not able to make an x-ray of chest. Fever is coming every 12 hours. But cough does not persist currently. The only problem is a fever. I am uploading the blood examination report. Please advice.\r\nDoctor:\r\nHi, I can understand your concern. I have gone through the report you have attached. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).\r\nYour total count is on the higher side of normal along with low hemoglobin. So start Azithromycin 500 mg 1-0-0, Tablet Dolo 650 1-0-1. Once your fever and cough subside, start an Iron tablet for low hemoglobin.\r\nI hope this helps.\r\nPatient:\r\nThank you doctor,\r\nHow many tablets of Azithromycin to be taken? Is it in the morning? I want to make you know that I have already taken Azithromycin five days before. Should she start it? And also can I start an Iron tablet today itself?\r\nDoctor:\r\nHi, Yes, you can take iron tablet from today onwards. And no need for Azithromycin now as you have already taken it. Drink plenty of fluids orally and keep yourself hydrated. Do warm water gargles and steam inhalation four to five times a day.\r\n\r\n"}
