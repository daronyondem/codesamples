{"Id":46,"Description":"How can minimal PTB with pneumonia be treated?\r\n\r\n","DialogueText":"Patient:\r\nThe reading of my chest x-ray states that there are hazed and confluent densities seen in the left upper lung field. The rest of the lungs are clear. The heart is not enlarged. The rest of the included structures are unremarkable. I am very much worried because the impression states that I have MINIMAL PTB, LEFT WITH PNEUMONIA. Please advice me on what to do best as I fear this might affect my application for renewal of contract.\r\nDoctor:\r\nHello, For Tuberculosis, AKT needs to be started. So confirm tuberculosis by sputum AFB stain and culture. If tuberculosis confirmed, then AKT should be started. And it is to be taken for around six months. Provide reports if available. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards,Dr. Parth Goswami\r\n\r\n"}
