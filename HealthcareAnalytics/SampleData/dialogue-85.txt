{"Id":85,"Description":"Suggest medication for Pulmonary embolism in right lung and pneumonia in left.\r\n\r\n","DialogueText":"Patient:\r\nAbout 6 weeks ago I was diagnosed with PE in right lung and phnemoia in the left lung. I was in teh hospital for 9 days. I am on 20mg of Warfin per day! My blood levels are holding steady at 2.67. Yesterday I had a bit of lower back pain and today it is between my shoulder blades, mostly on my right side. It hurts my back to breathe, swallow, and move. Just sore muscles or could it be something serious with the blood clot? I hate to rush into the doctor if it is nothing....I hope you can help! Thanks\r\nDoctor:\r\nThanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. Since you are taking warfarin (blood thinner), possibility of pulmonary embolism (PE) related pain is less likely.Possibility of musculoskeletal pain is more likely. So avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. Avoid movements causing pain. Apply warm water pad on affected areas of chest and back. Take painkiller and muscle relaxant drugs like ibuprofen and thiocolchicoside. You will mostly improve with all these in 2-3 days. If not improving then consult doctor. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.\r\n\r\n"}
