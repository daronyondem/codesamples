{"Id":129,"Description":"Why does one have difficulty in sleeping with history of pneumonia?\r\n\r\n","DialogueText":"Patient:\r\nMy father 82 years old was in the hospital for pneumonia and per cardiac catherization showing blockage. It was diagnosed that blockage was too much for bypass or stent. Only medication is given to help heart. Heart muscles also showed dead so it was no use to have bypass surgery per cardiac physician as even if blockage removed muscles would not help heart. My question is that now released from home he has been very uncomfortable during night sleep. He moans while asleep. He gets up and sits on bed. He then lays back and the same continues. He states being tired from hospital stay. He states he is tired from stay in hospital like hospital bed etc.  He really gets to sleep at 6 am and then during the day he is fine. Then the next night it starts again. Has been home since Feb. 2. Current medical doctor provided meds to sleep but that was worse. My mother is the primary caretaker and has reported his night sleep is off after returning home. Does the new diagnosis cause this or is there is a reason. Thanks.\r\nDoctor:\r\nHello dearWarm welcome to Healthcaremagic.comI have evaluated your query thoroughly .*  There are different  reasons  for this as    -  lung abscess -  effusion  -  cardiac  distress induced  -  lung hypoxia     due  to  altered  pulmonary pressure  -  anxiety  exacerbation  -  others .Hope this clears your query .Regards .\r\n\r\n"}
