{"Id":74,"Description":"What causes severe hair loss while recovering from pneumonia?\r\n\r\n","DialogueText":"Patient:\r\nHi, my name is Becky and I exasberated back in Sept with heavy pneumonia in my right lung...... the last few months I have experienced tremendous hair loss and breakage--it is so thin I only have about 1/3 of my hair left but no bald spots. I also have a big lump (or bulge) about 1 inch above the base of my hairline on the back of my head. It goes all across the back of my skull. Any advice? I thought you were here to help....... but hell no....... everybody wants my money....... which I don t have. Thanks alot\r\nDoctor:\r\nHello,After a long chronic disease, there is hair fall present, it is normal but you have a lump, and it is back, maybe it is a lipoma or subcutaneous abscess.You have to investigate all these things like serum biotin level, zinc level, FNAC of that lump after USG. Till then take tablet Astymin M forte for three months at least and biotin-rich foods.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Chandra Shekhar\r\n\r\n"}
