{"Id":124,"Description":"What are the symptoms of pneumonia?\r\n\r\n","DialogueText":"Patient:\r\ndiagnosed with type b flu on sunday, getting worse even with meds, now have rattling breathing and cough, only slight fevers that come and go, chest hurts, throat hurts, very weak, no appetite. And almost 33 weeks pregnant... could this be the sign of pneumonia coming on?\r\nDoctor:\r\nThanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. Yes, your symptoms are suggestive of pneumonia more. Pneumonia (lower respiratory tract infection) is common after upper respiratory tract infection (URTI).Worsening cough, chest congestion, rattling sound from chest, weakness, loss of appetite etc are characteristic symptoms of pneumonia. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and chest x ray (with abdominal shield).You should definitely start higher antibiotics to recover faster as you are pregnant. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.\r\n\r\n"}
