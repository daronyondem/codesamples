{"Id":68,"Description":"Can pneumonia reoccur in a patient due to exposure to pneumonia again?\r\n\r\n","DialogueText":"Patient:\r\nMy mother was admitted to St. Jude s last Wednesday with pneumonia. She is 82 and also has COPD and Parkinson s. She was treated with antibiotics and released four days later. She is to continue with antibiotics treatment at her skilled nursing facility for another 7 days. The day after she returned to her skilled nursing facility, she was given a new roommate who has advanced pneumonia and in critical condition. A few days earlier, the doctor at the hospital said that my mother s pneumonia was negative and she was taken out of isolation. Is it dangerous for my mother, who seems to be recovering or has recovered from her pneumonia, to be placed in the same room as a patient with advanced pneumonia?\r\nDoctor:\r\nHello,To be honest, there is a chance of cross infection from one person to another. However, this depends on so many factors and most of the infections, especially bacterial pneumonia, do not transmit easily. If more than one arm distance, the chance is very little and if not too close (like kissing etc.) the chance is further reduced. If two of them are already on antibiotics, as in your case, there is a chance but in the setting what u described, it is extremely unlikely. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards, \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0Dr. Mahboob Ur Rahman\r\n\r\n"}
