{"Id":153,"Description":"Suggest treatment for pneumonia\r\n\r\n","DialogueText":"Patient:\r\nI was recently diagnosed with Pneumonia. I had pneumonia when I was a baby but never since. I was shocked when I heard the diagnosis. The symptoms became apparent on March 28. I began taking Doxycycline Monohydrate on Monday April 3 and must take them for seven days. I am mega healthy and have not been sick in years. I can t even remember the last time I was sick. This has really knocked me out. I have zero energy and very little appetite.
