I would like to get tested for Covid19?\r\nDoctor:\r\nFlu like symptoms. Stay home for 7 days while you monitor your temperature. COVID 19 is typically associated with dry cough, fever and shortness of breath. Your nasal congestion and muscle aches are more typical of influenza. If you develop a fever or worsening, please arrange testing for both influenza and coronavirus. Drink fluids, rest and avoid contact with others.\r\n\r\n"}
