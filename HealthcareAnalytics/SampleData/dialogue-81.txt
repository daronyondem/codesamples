{"Id":81,"Description":"Are heaviness in the lungs, tinnitus and breathlessness symptoms of pneumonia?\r\n\r\n","DialogueText":"Patient:\r\nI have been sick for a week with what I thought was a head cold. My temp keeps going up and I m having trouble breathing. Sinuses are clear, ears are ringing but semi clear but hurt when swallowing along with sore throat. Non productive cough but lungs feel heavy and full. Could this be pneumonia I have developed? I have at it before. I must tell you that I do have asthma. Thank you!\r\nDoctor:\r\nHello,In my opinion, you should definitely consult a pulmonologist. There are two main possibilities for your symptoms. 1. Lung infection (pneumonia).2. Worsening of asthma.So you will need a chest x-ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). A chest x-ray is needed to rule out lung infection. PFT is needed to know the severity of asthma. You may need antibiotics, longer acting inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or salmeterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone).Don\u0027t worry you will be alright with all these.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards, Dr. Kaushal Bhavsar\r\n\r\n"}
