{"Id":175,"Description":"What causes cold sensations in the abdomen and back while having pneumonia?\r\n\r\n","DialogueText":"Patient:\r\nMy husband, age 63 is feeling cool on his abdomen and back while the rest of him is warm...currently sleeping. Last week was diagnosed with pneumonia...had a period last week when he was so cold, couldn t get warm so we went to the hospital. He says he is feeling fine and feels OK to work everyday (does construction work outside on a normal basis). Should I be concerned tonight that part of him feels cool even when under covera for an hour or two Thanks so much\r\nDoctor:\r\nHello and thank you for asking in HCM I can understand your concern Don\u0027t worry so much. Your husband is under treatment for pneumonia according to the history and he has had fever several times.Now he feels better but he is not completely asymptomatic which means that the feeling he had might be due to an episode of temperature not so high .This shows that the treatment is doing well. But he has to be careful with the treatment to be correct as the doctor has prescribed ,no smoking and not to work in dust environment ,a lot of liquids too.Take careWish a fast recovery for your husband.
