So, it is better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test).PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only.You will mostly improve with inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or salmeterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone).Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Kaushal Bhavsar\r\n\r\n"}
