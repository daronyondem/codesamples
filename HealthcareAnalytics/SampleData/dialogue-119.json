{"Id":119,"Description":"What reduces the suffocation feeling during the healing process of pneumonia?\r\n\r\n","DialogueText":"Patient:\r\ni am 46yrs old two wks ago i was diagnosed with pneumonia and the same time i had this suffercation feelin which was really scary i have had two lots of antibiotics and a nasal spray, today is the first day it has felt ok but im worried its goin to come back\r\nDoctor:\r\nThanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you are mostly having bronchospasm which is causing this suffocating feeling. Pneumonia causes inflammation in airways and this in turn causes bronchospasm. So in my opinion, you should ask your doctor about starting inhaled bronchodilators like formoterol or salmeterol to relieve bronchospasm. Also avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. Don\u0027t worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.\r\n\r\n"}
