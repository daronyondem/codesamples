{"Id":158,"Description":"Suggest treatment for chest cold after treated pneumonia in past\r\n\r\n","DialogueText":"Patient:\r\nmy son is 3 years old, and came down with a head cold wed, it moved immediately to his chest (he is a preemie-grad, and has had trouble with pneumonia and rsv in past) he is running a temp, and his respiratory rate is between 48-50.  I just don\u0027t know if i should wait it out a little longer to see what the day brings or take him in. I hate feelling like i\u0027m always there for the slightest things with him, but his history proves medical intervention always was the case. It just seems so quick that a lung issue would be evident, when he only started showing signs of a cold wednesday night.\r\nDoctor:\r\nHello,Your son\u2019s respiratory rate is too high. Please take him to ER immediately and take a chest x-ray immediately.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Siva Kumar Reddy\r\n\r\n"}
