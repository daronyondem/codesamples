{"Id":133,"Description":"Suggest treatment for pneumonia while on Levofloxacin\r\n\r\n","DialogueText":"Patient:\r\nA friend of mine has been treated for an, as yet unidentified, intestinal parasite with the antibiotic Levofloxacin. He was also diagnosed with a right lower lobe pneumonia discovered on CT scan. His physician told him that the antibiotic would take of both the pneumonia and the parasite. As a NP, I am familiar with Levaquin s use to combat pneumonia but the only antibiotics I can find for use as an antiparasitic are Tetracyline and Emycin if Metronidazole cannot be tolerated. Is Levofloxacin now also being used the way Emycin might be used in the absence of Flagyl?\r\nDoctor:\r\nRespected user , HiWarm welcome to Healthcaremagic.comI have gone through your concern in depth .*  Levofloxacin is best effective molecule for pneumonia and many intestine    bugs .*  Metronidazole  may be kept reserved on waiting for certain test reports      or clinically physician may not need  to  add to the drug cart according     to the evaluation and clinical experience .Hope this clears your doubt .Regards .\r\n\r\n"}
