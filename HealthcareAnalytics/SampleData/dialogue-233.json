But I am not sure if I just have a common cold or if I really need the test. I am monitoring my temperature which has been stable at around 37.3 or so.  I need some advice please?\r\nDoctor:\r\nIn brief:   If you meet criteria   You should test if you meet the criteria for testing, which currently states that you should have symptoms (cough/fever/shortness of breath/sore throat) PLUS contact with a confirmed or suspected case of Covid-19.    If you do not have a contact, then best would be to isolate yourself (which you will be doing on lockdown anyway).  Would you like to video or text chat with me?         \r\n\r\n"}
