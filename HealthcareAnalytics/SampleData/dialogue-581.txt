Should we get her tested?\r\nDoctor:\r\nMaybe. Has she been around anyone who has tested positive for COVID-19?  Is she having shortness of breath or labored breathing?  If so, then, yes, consider getting her tested.   If not, it is more likely that she has the flu or some other virus.  If it seems like more than just a regular cold, reach out to her pediatrician for more advice.\r\n\r\n"}
