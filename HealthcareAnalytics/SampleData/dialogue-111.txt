{"Id":111,"Description":"Suggest treatment for pneumonia\r\n\r\n","DialogueText":"Patient:\r\nJust found out I was pregnant. Yesterday diagnosed with pneumonia. I am a high risk pregnancy. Fertility issues, pcos, weak cervix. Delivered first daughter at 29 weeks, miscarried, and gave birth at 38 weeks to second daughter, but was on bedrest for weak cervix beginning at 5 months. I m a wreck. When I miscarried they said my progesterone level is low which caused me to miscarry, and gave me progesterone shots every week. Can t see doctor for two days.\r\nDoctor:\r\nThanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. Pneumonia with pregnancy is always critical.Antibiotics as early as possible is the treatment of choice for pneumonia. So better to immediately consult doctor and start antibiotics for pneumonia. Drink plenty of fluids orally and keep yourself hydrated. With prompt and appropriate treatment, pneumonia can be cured easily. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.\r\n\r\n"}
