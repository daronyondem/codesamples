Considering you have had TB in the past there are many possibilities for your present episodes of hemoptysis.  It could me a bacterial infection or relapse of TB or post TB bronchiectasis (abnormal permanent dilation of your airways at few places which happens when they get damaged due to your past TB). Take a course of antibiotic as prescribed by your physician ,Consult with your physician  and discuss about taking drugs like tranexemic acid which reduce the bleeding tendency , cough suppressants . while sleeping, Lie on the side which was previously affected by TB and be on complete bed rest . Once your hemoptysis gets controlled go for sputum examination to check for TB bacilli , chest x ray and if needed HRCT thorax (to pick up bronchiectasis which can sometimes be not evident on x ray). Since u mentioned severe back pain , vascular abnormalities concerning  the descending aorta (the major blood vessel carrying blood from the heart)needs to be also considered  Treatment is to be decided based on the cause for your hemoptysis.Do review with your physician and get the necessary investigations done.\r\n\r\n"}
