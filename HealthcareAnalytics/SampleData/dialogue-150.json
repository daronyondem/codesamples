{"Id":150,"Description":"What causes pneumonia in lungs with no other symptoms?\r\n\r\n","DialogueText":"Patient:\r\nmy mom was diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia back in late december. After a round of antibiotics, she felt much better but the xray still showed pneumonia. A round of stronger antibiotics were then given to her. She went back for a follow up xray last week and the xray now shows the pneumonia is in both lungs. The strange thing is...she has NO symptoms. No coughing, no fever, nothing. Could it possibly be viral? or fluid? or cancer???? Btw she has never smoked in her life.\r\nDoctor:\r\nThanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Radiological resolution takes 2-3 weeks in pneumonia. So it is possible that patient of pneumonia is improved symptomatically but still show pneumonia on chest x ray. So in my opinion, you should should waiting for 2 weeks more. Get done repeat chest x ray after 2 weeks.If chest x ray is showing pneumonia then go for CT thorax and bronchoscopy to rule out lung cancer, Tuberculosis, Fungal pneumonia. If xun4 ray is improving then no need to worry. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your mother. Thanks.\r\n\r\n"}
