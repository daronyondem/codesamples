Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia take more time to come under control, usually community acquired Staphylococcus infection may present with methicillne resistance(MRSA) , for this patient cases need to treated with vancomycine, and linezolid. Some patients also developed vancomycine resistant staph aureus (VRSA) infection, this infection very problematic to control. very few drugs like Quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid available to control VRSA. Please follow your doctor orders they will treat you in right way. I think I answered to your question if you have more questions please feel free to ask.\r\n\r\n"}
